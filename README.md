## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

After that just run 'ng serve' it will start the app on the url: localhost:3000


POINT DIDN'T MAKE OF THE CHALLENGE:

3. Show initially an input field where user can type an E-Mail address
4. Show a button next to the input field, that continues to step 5 when pressed
5. Validate the input and if the input is not an E-Mail address show an error message and stop
6. Since this is a known API user, save the E-Mail address so that it's automatically filled in the input
8. Make “todos” available to be started/stopped and completed or not
